//! Revisioned renderer- and platform-neutral accessibility trees and actions.
//!
//! [`crate::ui`] owns component-authored semantic inputs. This crate combines those inputs with
//! stable mounted identity, resolved strings, and layout geometry to form immutable per-view tree
//! snapshots and validated deltas. Platform adapters translate these records to native APIs; they
//! do not become a second semantic source of truth.
//!
//! This crate owns no pixels, renderer resources, native accessibility objects, callbacks, queue,
//! executor, event loop, or platform identity.
