//! Typed terminal outcomes for admitted platform requests.
//!
//! Admission and completion are deliberately separate. An adapter first validates a request and
//! either returns an immediate error or creates one [`AdmittedRequest`] for its issued
//! [`RequestId`]. Completing that non-cloneable token consumes it and produces one non-cloneable
//! [`RequestCompletion`]. This module records that transition; it owns no request executor, queue,
//! callback, service, native object, clock, or cancellation side effect.
