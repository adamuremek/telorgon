//! Platform-neutral scoped power-inhibition admission.
//!
//! Portable code may request semantic idle or system-sleep inhibition for an explicit application

//! duration, deadline, native inhibitor, or platform policy object and owns no power API, callback,
//! queue, executor, thread, timer, or event loop.
